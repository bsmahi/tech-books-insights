# 10 Core Best Practices for Optimizing API Endpoints

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Optimize SQL Queries**  
   - Analyze query execution plans and address bottlenecks.  
   - Cache frequent queries to minimize database load.

2. **Caching**  
   - Cache frequently requested data at the client, server, or CDN level.  
   - Use tools like Redis and implement cache invalidation strategies to avoid stale data.

3. **Payload Optimization**  
   - Compress large responses using Gzip.  
   - Remove unnecessary fields from payloads and use efficient formats like JSON.

4. **Pagination**  
   - Break large datasets into smaller chunks using `limit` and `offset` parameters.  
   - Use cursors for better consistency in real-time data.

5. **Asynchronous Processing**  
   - Offload time-intensive operations (e.g., file uploads, report generation) to background jobs.  
   - Use tools like RabbitMQ or Celery and return task IDs for status checks.

## Security Best Practices

6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**  
   - Set request limits to prevent abuse and ensure stable performance during traffic spikes.

7. **Input Validation and Sanitization**  
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs to protect against injection attacks like SQL injection or XSS.  
   - Ensure data integrity.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   - Track metrics (response time, error rates) using tools like Datadog or New Relic.  
   - Regularly review logs to detect trends, bottlenecks, or anomalies.

9. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Secure access with OAuth2, API keys, or JWT.  
   - Enforce resource restrictions for authorized users only.

10. **Encrypt Data in Transit**  
    - Use HTTPS to secure data exchanges and protect sensitive information from interception.
