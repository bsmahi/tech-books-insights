### 2. Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods

As a novice, writing even a simple Java program like "Hello, World" can feel overwhelming. Understanding the full class structure, syntax, and import statements at this stage can be quite cumbersome.

Instead of writing cluttered and verbose code, we’ll take a more minimalistic and simplified approach—thanks to a new feature introduced in JDK 25: _**compact source files with instance methods**_. This allows us to write Java code without the usual boilerplate, making it much easier for beginners to get started.

#### Before JDK 25

The classic way to begin learning any programming language is by writing a simple _**"Hello, World"**_ program—and the same holds true for Java.

```java
public class HellWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java World!");
    }
}
```
