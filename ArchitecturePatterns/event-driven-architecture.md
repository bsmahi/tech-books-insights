# A Bit of Architecture

Event-driven applications can play different roles in a system: they can be **producers**, **consumers**, or often both, functioning as **processors**.

## Key Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Components do not need explicit configuration to map to each other. They operate independently, unaware of each other's existence.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each application focuses on one core activity, aligning with the principles of modern microservices architecture.

## Communication in Microservices
- **Traditional Microservices**: Typically web-based, communicating over well-known protocols like HTTP.
- **Event-Driven Microservices**: Rely on **messaging middleware**, also known as the **message broker**, for communication.

This architectural style is particularly suited for scalable and flexible systems where asynchronous communication is key.

## Loose Coupling through Message Brokers

Unlike relational databases or similar systems, **messaging brokers** are specifically designed to:

- **Handle high throughput**: They can efficiently manage large volumes of data.
- **Ensure low-latency**: They facilitate fast data transmission with minimal delay.

These characteristics make messaging brokers the ideal **conduit** for communication between different **event-driven microservices**.
Their architecture is optimized for the high-performance demands of event-driven systems, enabling seamless integration

## Messaging Systems
## Popular Messaging Systems

Several messaging systems are commonly used in event-driven architectures:

- **RabbitMQ**: A widely used open-source message broker that supports multiple messaging protocols. For more details [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform designed for high throughput and fault tolerance. For more details [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- **Apache Pulsar**: A highly scalable, low-latency messaging system, often used for real-time data streams. For more details [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/)

## Cloud-Based Messaging Systems

Prominent public cloud providers offer their own messaging solutions:

- **AWS**: **Kinesis** – A real-time data streaming service that supports large-scale data ingestion and processing.
- **Google Cloud**: **Google Pub/Sub** – A messaging service designed for scalable event-driven systems and real-time analytics.
- **Azure**: **Event Hubs** – A data streaming platform that can handle high-throughput events and integrates with other Azure services.

These systems provide the necessary infrastructure for building event-driven microservices in the cloud, offering both scalability and reliability.

## Loose Coupling in Event-Driven Systems

In a **loosely coupled** event-driven system:

- The **producer application** publishes events to a **message broker**.
- The **consumer application** consumes events from the same message broker.
- The producer and consumer applications are unaware of each other’s existence, and both operate asynchronously.
- Communication occurs solely through the messaging broker.

### Benefits of Loose Coupling

This architecture enables powerful scaling opportunities. For instance:

- The producer can be **scaled to multiple instances**, each publishing events to the same destination in the message broker.
- Similarly, **multiple consumers** can process events, enabling more efficient data handling.

### Scaling Without Code Changes

In a properly designed event-driven system, scaling applications like this doesn’t require any changes to the application code. Instead, scaling is achieved through:

- **Configuration changes** (e.g., adjusting the number of consumers).
- **Operational changes** (e.g., modifying the system's resources or auto-scaling policies).

This flexibility allows the system to scale **up or down** automatically based on demand.

## Fault Tolerance in Event-Driven Systems

Most modern **messaging brokers** are designed with **fault tolerance** in mind, offering several mechanisms to ensure reliability and system resilience. These include:

### Producer Acknowledgments
- When producing a message, the application can ensure the message is successfully published by receiving an **acknowledgment** from the message broker.
  
### Consumer Acknowledgments
- On the consumer side, after processing an event, the consumer informs the message broker that it has completed the event processing by sending an **acknowledgment**.

### Benefits of Fault Tolerance
Event-driven applications benefit greatly from these fault-tolerant features:

- **Reliability**: Ensures that messages are not lost and consumers can reliably process events.
- **Resilience**: In case of failure, messages can be retried or reprocessed based on acknowledgment settings.
- **Scalability and robustness**: Helps applications remain stable and performant even under high load or failure conditions.

These mechanisms, along with other features provided by the messaging systems, contribute to the overall **fault tolerance** of the event-driven architecture.

## Real-Time and Streaming Data

Martin Kleppmann, in his book **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"**, highlighted the difference between **data at rest** (batch processing) and **data in motion** (stream processing). In event-driven systems, we're primarily dealing with **data in motion**, where data flows continuously and is processed in near real-time.

### Real-Time Systems Examples
- **Traffic Apps**: Constant data flow of traffic updates, processed in near real-time.
- **Video/Audio Streaming Apps**: Continuous data streams need to be processed almost immediately to provide real-time experiences.

These types of systems give the illusion of **real-time** event processing, where data is processed and acted upon as it arrives.

## Stream Processing

In certain use cases, **data that arrives late** (e.g., a few seconds or minutes) can become irrelevant or useless. Event-driven applications designed to process data in near real-time are often classified as **stream-processing** or **streaming data applications**.

- Stream-processing applications consume events, process them, and optionally produce output events.
- **Stream processing** is a subdomain of event-driven systems, with applications that must handle **continuous** data flows and real-time processing.

## Stream Processing Libraries

While many event-driven applications are simple and don't require specialized libraries, **complex stream-processing applications** often benefit from advanced abstractions, especially when dealing with **stateful stream processing** (e.g., tracking the state based on previous metrics).

### Examples of Stateful Stream Processing
- **Aggregating sales data** from a store over a rolling five-minute window.

### Specialized Libraries for Stream Processing

For such advanced use cases, developers typically rely on powerful libraries, including:

- **Kafka Streams**: A library for stream processing exclusively used with **Apache Kafka**.
- **Apache Flink**: A framework for distributed stream processing.
- **Spark Streaming**: A scalable and efficient stream processing library from **Apache Spark**.

These libraries offer the necessary tools and optimizations to handle complex stream-processing scenarios efficiently.

## Challenges of Event-Driven Architecture

Writing event-driven systems that require **high throughput** and **low latency** can be challenging, mainly due to the **distributed nature** of these systems. The inherent complexity of managing multiple distributed components makes it difficult to meet performance requirements consistently.

## Common Misconceptions in Distributed Systems

Peter Deutch’s **"Fallacies of Distributed Computing"** identifies eight common misconceptions that are highly relevant to event-driven systems:

1. **The network is reliable.**
2. **Latency is zero.**
3. **Bandwidth is infinite.**
4. **The network is secure.**
5. **The network topology doesn't change.**
6. **There is only one network system administrator.**
7. **The transport cost is zero.**
8. **The network is homogenous.**

These fallacies highlight issues related to **networking** in distributed applications, which are critical when building event-driven systems. Since **event-driven microservices** communicate over a network, it’s important to be aware of these misconceptions while designing and developing the system.

## The CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partitioning

The **CAP theorem** (Consistency, Availability, Partitioning) further complicates event-driven system design. The theorem defines three key properties:

- **Consistency (C)**: Every read returns the most recent write, ensuring data consistency.
- **Availability (A)**: Every node can read and write, even in the event of network failure.
- **Partitioning (P)**: The system can still function despite network partitioning (failure between nodes).

### The Challenge: Pick Two of Three

Eric Brewer’s **CAP theorem** (1998) states that no distributed system can guarantee all three properties simultaneously. A system can only offer two out of the three:

- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**: Guarantees consistency and high availability, usually achieved through replication.
- **AP (Availability + Partitioning)**: Guarantees high availability and partition tolerance, even during network failures.

Understanding which guarantees a messaging broker provides can help design efficient event-driven systems.

## Conclusion

While the **CAP theorem** and **distributed computing fallacies** may seem complex, understanding these principles is crucial for designing robust and efficient event-driven architectures.
