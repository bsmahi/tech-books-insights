## Title: Fundamentals of Software Architecture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Architecture is about the important stuff... whatever that is - Ralph Johnson

- A decade ago, software architects dealt only with the purely technical aspects of architecture, like modularity, components, and patterns.
- Since then, because of new architectural styles that leverage a wider swath of capabilities (like microservices), the role of software architect has expanded.

> Defintion: "_Software Architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented._"
> Yet architects designed modern architectural styles like microservices with the idea of incremental built in -- it is no longer expensive to make structural changes in microservices.

Other means of Software Architecture
 - Software Architecture as the _blueprint_ of the system.
 - The _roadmap_ for developing a system

Software Architecture consists of the _structure_ of the system, combined with 
  - Architecture Characteristics ("_ilities")
  - The system must support
  - Architecture Decisions
  - Architecture Design Principles

> [!Note]
> _Architecture = architecture characteristics + decisions + design principles_

- The structure of the system refers to the type of architectural style the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel)
- The architectural characteristics define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system.

### Architectural Characteristics 

Architectural Characteristics refers to the _"-ilities"_ that the system must support

1. Availability
2. Scalability
3. Fault Tolerance
4. Performance
5. Reliability
6. Securitt
7. Elasticity
8. Deployability
9. Testability
10. Agility
11. Recoverability
12. Learnability
